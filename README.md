Eternal_Capital
"Eternal Capital" is a web application that optimizes investors' portfolios using artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize financial gains. It serves as a virtual assistant for both beginners and advanced investors by providing recommendations on how many shares of each company to buy to ensure overall successful investments.

By retrieving real-time data from companies, all investors have access to the same information, enabling informed decision-making at every step.

Additionally, "Eternal Capital" facilitates seamless communication between users through a user-friendly and secure integrated chat feature. This encourages investors to support one another and build meaningful relationships.

A critical aspect of developing this web application was ensuring security, which was achieved through an authentication and access-control framework called Spring Security.

The backend and frontend sections can be found in the 'Production' branch, containing the complete code of the application.
