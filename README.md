"Eternal Capital" is a web application which successfully optimizes the investor's portfolios, using artificial intelligence algorithms, to maximize the financial gains.
This application plays a crucial role as a virtual assistant for biginners, or even advanced investors by generating a recommendation of how many stocks they will have to buy of each company in order to have a successful investment overall.

By getting the companies' data in real time, all investors will have the same information about them in order to make the right decision every step of the way.

On the other hand "Eternal Capital" enables seamless communication between users with the help of an easy to use and safe, integrated chat. This feature encourages investors to help each other and build close relationships.

A crucial aspect in building this web application was the security which was provided by an authentication and access-control framework called Spring Security.
